# Path morphing with flutter

PATH MORPHING, FROM FIGMA TO FLUTTER APP

## Context

I participated to the Flutter clock challenge with a coworker. The goal was to build a clock with Flutter for an iot device. Our biggest challenge was to create an animation between digits. We wanted each digit to transform their shapes.

The goals of this app is to create an animation between two digits.

This type of shape animation is called path morphing.
